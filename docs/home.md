# Hawks Robotics Documentation

Welcome to our documentation hub! This website contains all the information you'll need to write code for our team.

## New to this?

If you are new to programming as a whole, consider watching [this Java tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34). You don't have to follow the tutorial; we'll go over everything and let you begin writing code later. 

Java is our most commonly used programming language, and it's pretty essential to understand at least a little of it to get started.

### Want to build up to programming?
If you don't want to jump into text-based code right away, you can use the First Tech Challenge's [Blocks](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) language. It's a visual programming language that looks a lot like Scratch.

## Need Help?

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Know what you're doing?

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
