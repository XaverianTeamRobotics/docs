# What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a programming language designed by Google which operates using the same technology as Java. While our code is not
entirely in Kotlin, about 90% of it is, and no new code will be written in anything except Kotlin.

The official Kotlin language has [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) and an 
[online playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org).
