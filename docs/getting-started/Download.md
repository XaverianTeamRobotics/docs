# Installing Android Studio

**Android Studio** is the official IDE for Android development, and includes everything you need to build Android apps.
It is available from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

# Setting up Github

**Github** is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is used to keep track of changes made to 
code and to allow multiple people to work on the same codebase. Sign up at [https://github.com](https://github.com).
Then, ask a team captain to add you to the team's Github organization so you can make edits. The team's repository is 
[XaverianTeamRobotics/FtcRobotController](https://github.com/XaverianTeamRobotics/FtcRobotController).

---

Once both setup items are complete, you can import the project from Github in Android Studio.
