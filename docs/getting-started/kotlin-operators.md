# Operators in Kotlin

## Math Operators

Kotlin provides a set of math operators that you can use to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here are some of the commonly used math operators in Kotlin:

- Addition: The `+` operator is used to add two numbers together. For example, `val sum = 5 + 3` will assign the value `8` to the variable `sum`.

- Subtraction: The `-` operator is used to subtract one number from another. For example, `val difference = 10 - 5` will assign the value `5` to the variable `difference`.

- Multiplication: The `*` operator is used to multiply two numbers. For example, `val product = 2 * 4` will assign the value `8` to the variable `product`.

- Division: The `/` operator is used to divide one number by another. For example, `val quotient = 10 / 2` will assign the value `5` to the variable `quotient`.

- Modulus: The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example, `val remainder = 10 % 3` will assign the value `1` to the variable `remainder`.

- Increment and Decrement: The `++` and `--` operators are used to increment and decrement a number by `1` respectively. For example, `var count = 0; count++` will increment the value of `count` by `1`.

These are just a few examples of the math operators available in Kotlin. You can use them to perform various calculations and manipulate numeric values in your code.
