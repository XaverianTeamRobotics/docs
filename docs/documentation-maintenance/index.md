# Documentation Maintenance

On the main FtcRobotController repository, the docs are stored under HelpPage/doc.

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies, `npm run start` to start the development server, and `npm run build` to build the site.
:::tip
You can also use the run configurations in Android Studio/IDEA to run the development server.
:::

To deploy the site, run the `HelpPage/scripts/deploy.py` file in the terminal.
