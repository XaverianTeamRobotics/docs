# OpenCV Basics

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCv is a library for computer vision. It includes a lot of useful functions for image processing, 
such as color detection, object detection, and more.

It works differently than object detectors like TensorFlow. Instead of using a neural network to detect objects,
OpenCV allows you to program your own set of algorithms to detect objects or patterns in images.

It is the most difficult to program, as you need to program the logic yourself, but it is also the most flexible and
doesn't require any pre-trained models.
